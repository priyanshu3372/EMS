 * administrator and a member of staff would have no way to request leave.

 * They asked for leave types to be "flexible", editable by whoever runs leave,
 * and left the exact roles to us. `leave:type:manage` goes to super_admin,
 * admin and HR.
 *
 * NOT to manager or RM, deliberately. A manager approves their own team's
 * requests; company-wide quotas and carry-forward rules are a different kind of
 * decision, and a manager who could raise the quota for the people they also
 * approve leave for would be on both sides of it.
