/**
 * Every permission in the system, named once.
 *
 * Code asks `can('payroll:run:create')`, never `role === 'accounts'`. The
 * difference matters the first time the client says "let HR run payroll too":
 * with permissions that is one line in roles.ts, and with role checks it is a
 * hunt through every file for the ones somebody forgot.
 *
 * Because this is a union type rather than a list of strings, a typo like
 * 'payroll:run:crate' fails to compile instead of silently denying access
 * forever — which is the kind of bug nobody reports, because from the outside
 * it just looks like the feature does not work for them.
 *
 * WHAT versus WHOSE. A permission says what an action is; it does NOT say which
 * rows it covers. A manager and an employee both hold `leave:read`; what
 * differs is the data scope (see scope.ts), which decides whether that means
 * their team's leave or only their own. Splitting the two is what keeps this
 * list short — the alternative is a separate permission for every combination.
