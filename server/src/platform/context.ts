/**
 * Everything a service needs to know about the caller, in one object.
 *
 * It lives in `platform/` rather than in `http/` because of the dependency
 * direction: http → modules → domain, never the reverse. A service that
 * imported the request context from http would invert that, and the first
 * consequence would be a service that cannot be called from a CLI script or a
 * scheduled job because it wants an Express response object.
 *
 * `db` is already scoped to the caller's organization. A service never builds
 * its own client and never sees the raw one, so there is no way to widen the
 * company filter from inside a module.
