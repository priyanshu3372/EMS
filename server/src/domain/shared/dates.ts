/**
 * Dates, in the company's timezone.
 *
 * NOTHING ELSE IN THE SYSTEM MAY CALL toISOString() TO GET A CALENDAR DAY, and
 * this file is why. The server runs in UTC. An employee punching in at 9am in
 * Pune is doing so at 03:30 UTC — same day, no problem. One punching out at
 * 11:30pm is doing so at 18:00 UTC, also fine. But a night-shift punch at
 * 12:30am IST is 19:00 UTC THE PREVIOUS DAY, and `new Date().toISOString()`
 * would file it under yesterday.
 *
 * That bug is invisible for months. It shows up as one employee whose hours
 * never add up, and it is blamed on them before it is blamed on the code.
 *
 * So every calendar day in this system comes from here, with the organization's
 * timezone passed in explicitly. There is no default and no machine clock.
 *
 * This module imports NOTHING. It is pure arithmetic over values it is given,
 * which is what makes it testable without a database, a request or a clock.
