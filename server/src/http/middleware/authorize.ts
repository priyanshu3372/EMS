 * Always AFTER authenticate — there is no context to read otherwise, and the
 * 401 you would get instead of a 403 would be confusing rather than wrong.
 *
 * This is the second of the four layers in guide §A7, and on its own it is not
 * enough. It answers "may this person create employees at all", not "may they
 * edit THIS one" — that is the data scope, applied in the repository. A route
 * guarded here and unscoped there is still an IDOR hole.
 *
 * The refusal is logged. An employee hitting /payroll once is a mistyped URL;
 * the same employee hitting it forty times in a minute is something else, and
 * neither is visible without a record.
