/**
 * Establishes who is calling, from the Authorization header.
 *
 * The signature check alone is not enough. A signed token stays
 * cryptographically valid until it expires, so terminating someone, or their
 * password being changed after a theft, would have no effect for up to fifteen
 * minutes. The tokenVersion comparison closes that window: the version is
 * raised on termination, password change and refresh-token reuse, and any token
 * carrying an older one dies at its very next request.
 *
 * THE ROLE COMES FROM THE DATABASE, NOT FROM THE TOKEN. The token carries a
 * role claim, but it is used only for logging, never for a decision. Trusting
 * it would mean a demotion took fifteen minutes to bite — and the fifteen
 * minutes right after someone is demoted is exactly when it matters. Since the
 * tokenVersion check already costs one read, the current role comes back in the
 * same query and costs nothing extra.
 *
 * That read is a deliberate trade. A stateless check would be marginally faster
 * and would make instant revocation impossible, which for a payroll system is
 * the wrong side of the bargain.
