/**
 * Rate limits for the auth routes.
 *
 * Built today rather than on Day 20, because a login endpoint with no limit is
 * an open invitation from the moment it is reachable, and "we will add it at
 * the end" is how it ends up shipped without one.
 *
 * The design problem here is that everyone in the client's office arrives from
 * ONE IP address. A naive "ten attempts per IP" would mean the eleventh person
 * to sign in on Monday morning is locked out — and the obvious fix, raising the
 * limit, is also what makes it useless against an attacker. So there are two
 * limits doing two different jobs:
 *
 *   per identifier   Ten tries at ONE account. This is the one that actually
 *                    stops password guessing, and a shared office IP does not
 *                    affect it, because colleagues are not all signing in as
 *                    each other.
 *   per IP           Generous, and aimed at a different attack: spraying one
 *                    common password across many accounts, which never trips
 *                    the per-identifier limit because each account is tried
 *                    only once.
