/**
 * Creating and editing employees.
 *
 * THREE FIELDS ARE DELIBERATELY ABSENT, and their absence is the point of this
 * file:
 *
 *   role      lives on Membership, and is changed only through
 *             PUT /memberships/:id/role, which only super_admin can call. If it
 *             were accepted here, anyone with `employee:update` — HR, Admin —
 *             could promote themselves to super_admin by editing their own
 *             employee record. That is the privilege-escalation path the audit
 *             found, and it is closed by the field simply not existing.
 *
 *   status    is ACCOUNT status, not HR status, and belongs to
 *             PATCH /users/:id/status. Deactivating someone must also revoke
 *             their tokens, which an employee update does not do.
 *
 *   ctc       and every other salary component. §3.2 gives "Manage salary
 *             structures" to super_admin and accounts ONLY — and HR creates
 *             employees. Accepting a salary here would hand HR a permission the
 *             client explicitly withheld.
 *
 * `.strict()` on every object makes that enforceable rather than aspirational.
 * An unknown key is a 422 naming the field, not a silently ignored one — so a
 * request carrying `role` fails loudly instead of appearing to succeed.
