 * anything it is less trusted, because nobody read it before uploading.
 *
 * `.strict()` is deliberately NOT used here. Unknown COLUMNS are normal — a
 * roster exported from another system carries all sorts of extra fields — and
 * refusing the whole file because it has a "Blood Group" column would be
 * obstructive. Extra columns are ignored; the dangerous fields are excluded by
 * never being read, not by being rejected.
