 * Builds the AppContext for a request and hands it back to controllers.
 *
 * Stored on res.locals rather than bolted onto req, and read back through
 * appContext() rather than accessed directly, so a controller cannot quietly
 * proceed with `undefined` when the middleware was forgotten. An exception is
 * the right outcome there; `undefined` where an organizationId belongs is how
 * data crosses between companies.
 *
 * The scoped Prisma client is built ONCE here, from the organization on the
 * verified token. No service constructs one, so none can choose a different
 * organization than the one the caller is authenticated for.
