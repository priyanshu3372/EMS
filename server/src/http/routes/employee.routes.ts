 * `authorize('employee:read')` answers "may this person read employees at all".
 * It does NOT answer "may they read THIS one" — that is the data scope, applied
 * in the repository. A route guarded here and unscoped there is still an IDOR
 * hole, which is why the repository requires a scope argument to compile.
 *
 * POST and PATCH are gated on their own permissions, not on employee:read —
 * being able to see the directory is not being able to change it.
