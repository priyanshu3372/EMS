/**
 * Mounted at /api/users.
 *
 * Every route here is super_admin-only in practice, because §3.2 gives "Invite
 * users", "Manage roles/status" and "Delete users" to that role alone. That is
 * expressed as four separate permissions rather than one `is_super_admin`
 * check, so the client can move any of them to another role later without a
 * code change here.
 *
 * `membership:role:assign` is deliberately its own permission and not folded
 * into `user:status:update`. Deactivating somebody and promoting somebody are
 * different powers, and an organisation that wants to delegate the first
 * without the second must be able to.
