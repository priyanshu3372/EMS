/**
 * What a session looks like to the client.
 *
 * Built by naming every field, never by spreading the identity and deleting
 * what should not go out. AuthIdentity already carries `passwordHash`, and the
 * list will grow — a statutory id, a bank reference. An allow-list keeps every
 * one of those out by default; a deny-list leaks each new field once, and only
 * tells you afterwards.
 *
 * `permissions` is sent so the UI can hide what the user cannot do. It is a
 * convenience for the interface and NOTHING MORE — the server re-derives
 * permissions from the role on every single request and never reads this list
 * back. A client that edited it would change which buttons it draws for itself,
 * and nothing else.
 *
 * Sending the list rather than the role is the point. If the frontend had only
 * `role` it would write `role === 'hr'` in fifty components, and the day the
 * client moves one right between roles, fifty components are wrong.
