/**
 * What an employee looks like over the wire.
 *
 * SNAKE_CASE, deliberately. The pages were written against Supabase and read
 * `full_name`, `employee_id`, `date_of_joining`. Emitting camelCase would mean
 * editing every page in the same commit that changes where the data comes
 * from — two risky changes at once, and no way to tell which one broke a
 * screen. The v1 contract is snake_case; a rename is its own task, later.
 *
 * ALLOW-LIST, always. Every field is named. Nothing is spread, nothing is
 * deleted. A column added to the Employee table next month does not appear in
 * an API response until somebody writes it here on purpose.
 *
 * The three sensitive blocks are merged in only when the caller holds the
 * permission — and the repository has not even fetched them otherwise, so
 * there is nothing here to leak by accident.

 * The browser gets a number because the pages already do arithmetic on these

 * are far below the point where a double loses whole rupees.
 *
 * It is not safe for calculation, which is why no calculation happens here.
 * Payroll arithmetic runs on the server in Decimal, and the browser is shown
 * the result rather than deriving it. If a screen ever needs to add these up
 * for anything that matters, that sum belongs in an endpoint.
