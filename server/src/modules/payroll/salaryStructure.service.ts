/**
 * Setting what somebody is paid.
 *
 * The client's flow is "Accounts creates salary structure → creates payroll
 * run", and until this existed the first half had nowhere to happen: the
 * employee form refuses salary fields by design, and nothing else wrote one. A
 * payroll run needs a salary on record for every person it pays.
 *
 * THREE CASES, and the difference matters for every payslip ever issued:
 *
 *   First salary     Opened from the date given. Nothing to close.
 *
 *   A raise          A LATER date. The current record is closed the day before
 *                    and a new one opens. March's payslip is still explained by
 *                    March's figures, because they were never touched.
 *
 *   A correction     The SAME date as the current record — a typo caught before
 *                    anything was paid on it. The figures are replaced in
 *                    place. Once payroll runs exist (Day 16), a correction to a
 *                    month already paid must be refused; that check belongs
 *                    with them, since they are what records a month as paid.
 *
 * An EARLIER date than the current record is refused: it would rewrite a
 * period that already had a salary, which is a correction wearing a new date.
