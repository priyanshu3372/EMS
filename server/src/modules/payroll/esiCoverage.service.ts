/**
 * Who is covered by ESI, decided ONCE per contribution period.
 *
 * This is the file that fixes the bug the audit named: `Payroll.jsx:23` asked
 * "is gross ≤ 21,000?" every single month, so an employee who got a raise in
 * June stopped contributing in June, and one who took unpaid leave in August
 * started again in August. The same person drifted in and out of a government
 * insurance scheme depending on what they happened to earn that month, and
 * nobody could explain it to them because it was not a decision anybody made.
 *
 * ESIC does not work that way. Eligibility is tested at the START of a
 * contribution period — 1 April or 1 October — or on the date somebody joins if
 * that falls mid-period. Whatever it decides holds until the period ends. Cross
 * the threshold in June and you keep contributing until 30 September; that is
 * not a loophole, it is the rule, and it exists so that cover does not
 * evaporate the month after somebody's pay rises.
 *
 * So coverage is a RECORD, not a calculation. It is written once, it says why,
 * and every payslip in the period reads it rather than re-deciding. A stored
 * decision can be shown to an employee who asks. A recomputed one cannot even
 * be shown to the person who wrote the code.
