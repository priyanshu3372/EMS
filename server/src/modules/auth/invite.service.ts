 * creating an employee with a login, by the roster import — and each one gave
 * back a single-use link. Nothing accepted the link. So every invited person
 * was stuck at "This account has not been activated yet" for ever, and the
 * only account that could ever sign in was the one bootstrap created.
 *
 * Also the way back in after a forgotten password. There is no email in v1, so
 * self-service reset is not possible; an administrator issues a reset link and
 * hands it over, and it is redeemed here exactly like an invitation.
