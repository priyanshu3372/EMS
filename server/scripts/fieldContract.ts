/**
 * Records every field name the frontend reads, so the API cannot quietly stop
 * sending one.
 *
 *   npm run field-contract
 *
 * The problem this solves is specific. Over the next twelve days each module's
 * data moves from Supabase to our own API, and every one of those swaps is an
 * opportunity to drop a field. The page will not crash — it will render
 * `undefined`, which looks like an empty cell, and nobody notices until the
 * client asks why the designation column is blank.
 *
 * So the field names are pinned NOW, while the old code is still the source of
 * truth about what the UI needs. A serializer written on Day 8 can then be
 * checked against this file rather than against somebody's memory.
 *
 * It is a heuristic, not a parser: it looks for snake_case property reads,
 * which in this codebase means a column name coming back from the database.
 * camelCase is deliberately excluded — that is React state and local variables,
 * which are nobody's contract. Over-reporting here is harmless; the file is a
 * checklist, not a test.
