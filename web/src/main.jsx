 * too few, none. A failed save looked exactly like a successful one: the modal
 * closed, the toast never came, and the user found out a week later that the
 * employee they added was not there.
 *
 * Registering it on the CACHE rather than per-hook is what makes that
 * impossible to repeat. A new hook written next month is covered without anyone
 * remembering to cover it, and a page that wants special handling adds its own
 * on top rather than being the only thing standing between an error and silence.
