/**
 * The only place in this app that talks to the network.
 *
 * Three decisions are worth understanding before changing anything here.
 *
 * 1. THE ACCESS TOKEN LIVES IN A VARIABLE, NOT IN localStorage.
 *    Anything in localStorage is readable by any script that runs on the page,
 *    including one injected through a dependency. A token held in a module
 *    variable dies with the tab, and the refresh cookie — which JavaScript
 *    cannot read at all — is what survives a reload. That is the entire reason
 *    there are two tokens instead of one.
 *
 * 2. EVERY FAILURE THROWS.
 *    The audit found zero error handlers in the old codebase, because the old
 *    client returned `{ data, error }` and nobody checked `error`. A function
 *    that throws cannot be ignored: TanStack Query marks the query failed, the
 *    global handler in main.jsx shows a toast, and the page cannot render
 *    success state over a failure. Silent failure stops being possible.
 *
 * 3. REFRESH IS SINGLE-FLIGHT.
 *    The server rotates refresh tokens, and a token can be spent exactly once —
 *    presenting one twice is treated as theft and kills the session. So if four
 *    queries expire together, four parallel refreshes would log the user out.
 *    `refreshInFlight` makes the other three wait for the first.
