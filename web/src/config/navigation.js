 * Which permission each page needs — named once, read by both the router and
 * the sidebar.
 *
 * Before this, the sidebar carried a list of role names per link and App.jsx
 * carried its own. They agreed by coincidence, and the failure mode was quiet:
 * a link visible in the sidebar that bounces you back to the dashboard when you
 * click it, or worse, a page reachable by URL that the sidebar had hidden.
 *
 * Permissions rather than roles, because the client will move rights between
 * roles and that must not be a code change here.
