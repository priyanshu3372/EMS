 * Hides a route from someone who lacks the permission it needs.

 * `allowedRoles={['super_admin', 'accounts']}`, which meant every change to who
 * may see payroll was a change to this file AND to the sidebar AND to whatever
 * else had its own copy of the list.
 *
 * This is presentation only. It stops a wrong turn from showing an empty,
 * broken page; it is not a security control, because anything it hides is still
 * one fetch away. The server checks every request independently.
