 * Which days the company is closed.

 * it: "which days are we off" is a question about leave, not about PF rates.
 * The endpoint it happens to use is an implementation detail.
 *
 * Each day saves on click, like the other toggles here. A Save button that has
 * to be found afterwards is how a half-finished change ends up looking exactly
