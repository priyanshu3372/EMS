/**
 * Employees, from the server.
 *
 * This file used to talk to Supabase — and, with no Supabase configured, to a
 * mock kept in the browser's localStorage. So the Employees page showed people
 * who did not exist anywhere the rest of the system could see: the attendance
 * roster, leave and payroll all read the real server and matched none of them.
 *
 * What the old create did that this does not, deliberately:
 *   · take a password — a new person gets an invitation link instead, so
 *     nobody types a colleague's first password into a form;
 *   · save salary — that is Accounts' to set, under Payroll, and the employee
 *     endpoints refuse a salary field outright;
 *   · save bank details — those go through their own verification flow;
 *   · notify hardcoded "demo-hr-admin-id" users who never existed.
 *
 * Bodies are sent in the server's shape (camelCase). Responses come back in
 * the snake_case the pages already read.
