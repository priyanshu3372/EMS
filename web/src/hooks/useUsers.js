/**
 * Users and access, now served by our own API.
 *
 * These four ran as Supabase edge functions until today. The hook NAMES and
 * ARGUMENT SHAPES are unchanged on purpose, so Settings → Users did not have to
 * be rewritten in the same commit that replaced the backend behind it. When
 * both halves change at once and a screen breaks, there is no way to tell which
 * half did it.
 *
 * ONE THING TO KNOW ABOUT IDS. The `user_id` these mutations take is the
 * MEMBERSHIP id, not the User id — it is `row.id` from the list below. That is
 * correct: access is granted per company, so what is being changed is this
 * person's membership of THIS company, not the person. The awkward name is kept
 * because the page already passes it; a rename is its own task.
