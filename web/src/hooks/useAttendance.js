/**
 * Attendance, served by our own API.
 *
 * THE BUG THIS REPLACES. The month query used to build its range end as
 * `${year}-${month}-31`. In February, April, June, September and November that
 * string is not a date, so the query returned nothing and the monthly view was
 * BLANK FIVE MONTHS A YEAR.
 *
 * Nobody reported it as a bug. They reported that attendance "sometimes does
 * not load", which is a much harder thing to act on — and it is why the range
 * is now built on the server, half-open, from a year and a month.
 *
 * Hook names and argument shapes are unchanged, so the Attendance page did not
 * have to be rewritten in the same commit that moved the data.
