# Role & Permission Documentation

**EMS — CareerMap Solutions** | Version 1.0 | 11 July 2026

---

## 1. Introduction

This document defines who can access what in the Employee Management System (EMS). It covers all 7 user roles, their permissions, and how security is enforced.

**Why RBAC?** Instead of configuring permissions per user, we assign a role. The role determines what pages, data, and actions a user can access — consistently, securely, and at scale.

## 5. Data Visibility (RLS)

The database enforces row-level security even if the frontend is bypassed.

| Table | Super Admin | Admin | HR | Manager/RM | Accounts | Employee |
|-------|:-----------:|:-----:|:--:|:----------:|:--------:|:--------:|
| profiles | All | All | All | All | All | All |
| attendance | All | ❌ | All | Own + reports | ❌ | Own |
| leave_requests | All | ❌ | All | Own + reports | ❌ | Own |
| leave_balances | All | ❌ | All | Own | ❌ | Own |
| salary_structures | All | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | All | Own |
| payroll_runs | All | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | All | ❌ |
| payslips | All | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | All | Own |
| documents | All | All | All | All | All | All |
| employee_documents | All | All | All | ❌ | ❌ | Own |
| holidays | All | All | All | All | All | All |
| notifications | All | Own | Own | Own | Own | Own |

---

## 6. Role Hierarchy

```
Super Admin ─── Full control
  ├── Admin ─── Employees + Documents
  ├── HR ─── Employees + Attendance + Leave + Documents
  ├── Accounts ─── Payroll only
  └── Manager / RM ─── Team leave & attendance
        └── Employee ─── Self-service only
```

> [!NOTE]
> This is a **flat RBAC model** — roles do NOT inherit permissions from higher roles. Each role is independently defined.

---

## 7. Key Workflows

### Leave Request

```
Employee applies → Manager/RM/HR reviews → Approve or Reject
                                              ↓
                              DB trigger auto-deducts leave balance
```

### Document Verification

```
Employee uploads file → HR/Admin reviews → Verify or Reject (with remarks)
```

### Payroll

```
Accounts creates salary structure → Creates payroll run (draft)
  → Auto-generates payslips → Updates status: draft → approved → paid
```

### Employee Onboarding

```
HR/Super Admin fills form → RPC creates auth user + profile + leave balances
```

### User Invitation (Super Admin only)

```
Settings → Invite → Edge function validates caller is super_admin
  → Sends email invite → Creates profile with status = 'invited'
```

## 8. Security Model

### Three Layers of Enforcement

| Layer | What It Does | Bypass-proof? |
|-------|-------------|:-------------:|
| **Frontend Route Guards** | `ProtectedRoute` blocks page navigation by role | No (client-side) |
| **Edge Function Auth** | JWT verification + role check for user management | ✅ |
| **Database RLS Policies** | Row-level security on all 11 tables | ✅ |

### Key Security Details

| Area | Implementation |
|------|----------------|
| Authentication | Supabase Auth (email/password), JWT tokens |
| Token expiry | 1 hour, with refresh token rotation |
| Password hashing | bcrypt via pgcrypto |
| Self-protection | Super Admin cannot modify own account via edge function |
| Role validation | `has_role()` and `has_any_role()` SQL functions (SECURITY DEFINER) |

---

## 9. Developer Quick Reference

| Role | Sidebar Items | Route Guard | RLS Scope |
|------|---------------|-------------|-----------|
| `super_admin` | All 8 modules | No restrictions | All rows, all tables |
| `admin` | Dashboard, Employees, Documents | Blocked: Payroll, Reports, Settings | No attendance/leave/payroll data |
| `hr` | Dashboard, Employees, Attendance, Leave, Documents | Blocked: Payroll, Reports, Settings | All rows in people tables |
| `manager` / `rm` | Dashboard, Employees, Attendance, Leave | Blocked: Payroll, Documents, Reports, Settings | Own + `reporting_manager_id = auth.uid()` |
| `accounts` | Dashboard, Payroll | Blocked: Employees, Attendance, Leave, Docs, Reports, Settings | All payroll tables only |
| `employee` | Dashboard, Attendance, Leave, Documents | Blocked: Employees, Payroll, Reports, Settings | `employee_id = auth.uid()` only |

**When adding a new role:**
1. Add to `profiles.role` CHECK constraint (schema.sql + migration)
2. Add RLS policies for the role on relevant tables
3. Add to `NAV` array in `Sidebar.jsx`
4. Add to `ProtectedRoute` wrappers in `App.jsx`
5. Add to `ROLE_LABELS` mapping

## 10. Testing Checklist

### Login

- [ ] Each role can log in with email or Employee ID
- [ ] Invalid credentials show error
- [ ] Logout clears session

### Permissions (test per role)

- [ ] Sidebar shows only permitted modules
- [ ] Direct URL to restricted page → redirects to `/dashboard`
- [ ] CRUD operations work on permitted modules
- [ ] CRUD operations blocked on restricted modules (RLS error)

### Negative Tests

- [ ] Employee cannot see approve/reject buttons
- [ ] Manager accessing `/payroll` → redirected
- [ ] Accounts querying attendance API → empty result (RLS)
- [ ] Non-super_admin calling invite-user → 403
- [ ] Super Admin modifying own account → "Cannot modify your own account"

### Security

- [ ] Unauthenticated access → redirected to `/signin`
- [ ] Expired JWT → triggers re-authentication
- [ ] RLS enabled on all 11 tables
- [ ] Passwords stored as bcrypt hashes

## 11. Future Enhancements

| Enhancement | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Custom roles** | Dynamic role creation via a `roles` table instead of CHECK constraint |
| **Temporary permissions** | Time-bound elevated access (e.g., acting manager for 2 weeks) |
| **Department-scoped HR** | HR restricted to specific departments |
| **Multi-level approvals** | Leave: RM → HR → Auto-approved chain |
| **Audit dashboard** | Log all login, CRUD, and role-change events |
| **2FA** | TOTP-based two-factor for Super Admin & Accounts |
| **Time-based access** | Restrict payroll module to business hours only |
